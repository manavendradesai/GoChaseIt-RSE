# GoChaseIt-RSE
Project 2 of the Robotics Software Engineering Nanodegree Program of Udacity. 

Outcomes -->

- Designed a differential drive robot, with a camera and lidar, in URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and housed it in a world different from that in Project 1
- Added Gazebo plugins for the robot’s differential drive capability, lidar, and camera
- Wrote C++ client and server nodes to read the robot's camera image, analyzes it to determine the presence and position of a white ball, and drive the robot towards it
